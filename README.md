# FrameNet in Python

I'm now maintaining [Patrick Ye](http://ww2.cs.mu.oz.au/~jingy/)'s Python library for accessing [FrameNet](http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/) data. This version works with FrameNet version 1.3.

## Getting Started

First you must obtain and install the FrameNet XML files, which are free for non-commerical and require an application.  Then, you can obtain the Python Library and run:

    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install
