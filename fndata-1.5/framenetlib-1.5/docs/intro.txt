Introduction
==============

framenetlib helps to process XML instance documents that obey the
framenet XML schema.

With framenetlib (framenetlib.py) you can write
Python code to:

- Parse an XML document that obeys the framenet XML schema,
  creating instances of the Python classes that represent the types
  defined in the framenet schema.  These Python classes are
  defined in framenetlib.py.

- Create instances of classes that represent the types described in
  the framenet XML schema.

- Write Python application code that uses the classes that
  represent framenet types.

- Export the objects to an XML document.


Schemas
---------

The framenetlib.py module in this package was generated from the
XML schemas in ./schemas.


generateDS.py
---------------

The framenetlib.py module in this package was generated by
generateDS.py.  You can learn about generateDS.py here:
